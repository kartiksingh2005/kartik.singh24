# 🚀 Algorand Smart Bank — AI Credit Scoring Platform

## 🧠 Overview

Algorand Smart Bank is an AI-powered fintech application that predicts a user’s **creditworthiness** using Machine Learning.
The platform analyzes financial behavior — income, expenses, UPI activity, savings, and bill payments — to generate a real-time credit score and risk profile.

Built during a hackathon, this project combines **Web3 (Algorand blockchain)** with **ML-driven financial intelligence** to create a smarter, transparent credit system.
